Variables
If x=10, y=0,and i=8 what will i+b equal?
1 A NameError
2 80
3 0
4 A SyntaxError
1 A NameError
The variable b is not defined, therefore a NameError message is the result
Data Types
The integer data type can contain numbers and a decimal
1 True
2 False
3 n/a
4 n/a
2 False
An integer is a number without a decimal
Loops
A while loop will continue until a conditon is met
1 True
2 False
3 n/a
4 n/a
1 True
While loops continue until a conditon is met to break the loop
Operators

1 Not Valid
2 Addition
3 Division
4 Exponential
1 Not Valid
The symbol ^ is not a valid operator for any operation
Functions
To call the function def list_name(first,last) /you MUST call a parameter to have it run correctly
1 True
2 False
3 n/a
4 n/a
1 True
In the function, list_name, the parameters first and last /must be given for the function to run
Random
What is the code for 1+1-2?
1 add(3-1-2)
2 1+1-2+1
3 print(1+1-2)
4 sum(4+100-10)
3 print(1+1-2)
The code to output 1+1-2 will use a print statement, /unless the equation is assigned to a variable

3 open(fileName, Mode)
open(fileName, Mode) is the correct way to open and read or write to a file
Functions
If you have a function, main(), that /calls the function, read() what /is the easiest way to call read()
1 read()
2 main()
3 main(read())
4 read(fileName)
1 read()
Simply calling the read() function at the end of the program /would be the fastest way to call the function
